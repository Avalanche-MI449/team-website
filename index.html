<!-- Ingia's Bio -->
<img src="images/Ingie Bio Image.jpg" alt="Ingie's Picture" class="headshot">

<p>Ingie Charles, a Haitian-American from Florida, is now in her fifth (and last) at Michigan State University. Majoring in Information Science and minoring in Korean, she hopes to climb the ladder in her career to where she wishes to become a project manager. She, as well, has the desire to get her masters degree or live as a digital nomad abroad in either South Korea or Taiwan.</p>

<p>When she's not worrying over how she will achieve these goals, you will find her putting together a jigsaw puzzle, learning a new choreography at the dance studio, or watching King of the Hill in the comfort of her dorm.</p>
